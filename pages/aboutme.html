<!-- TODO: This isn't a particularly aesthetic page. I think the text needs to be justified and maybe the columnar look doesn't work even on desktop. -->
<!-- Additionally, I need a better, more professional photo. I would also like to spice this page up a bit. Maybe add more than one photo, split it into sections, etc. -->
<!-- Based on the D&D feedback, the aesthetic doesn't fit, but some of the jokes landed well (e.g. Alignment: vim). Maybe I can still make some kind of fake license for a banner. -->

            Hi, I'm Austin. I'm a Software Engineer based in the Hartford, CT area, and I'm Currently specializing in web application development at a VeraCore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a rich history in the software engineering domain, dating back to my middle school years on a robotics team where my love of computer science developed. From there I explored technology domains, from front-end web design to system administration, throughout high school until I settled on majoring in Computer Science & Engineering at University of Connecticut. Now I have nearly 3 years of professional full-stack development experience with modern technology stacks,  and a burning desire to keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work I keep updated on other software development domains, such as desktop applications and embedded systems, but if you can't find me huddled up with some friends trying to debug server problems then I'm probably bouldering at a nearby climbing gym, shredding snow on the mountains of the Northeast, or rendering 3D models at the nearest Maker Space.
