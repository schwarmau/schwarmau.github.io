            Hi, I'm Austin (if that wasn't obvious already). I've been developing software for a few years now, and look forward to the years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a rich history in the software engineering domain, dating back to my middle school years on a robotics team where my interest in computer science originally sprung to life. From there I explored technology domains, from front-end web design to system administration and security, until I settled on majoring in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Connecticut. Now I have nearly 3 years of professional full-stack development experience with modern technology stacks, and a desire to keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work I keep updated on other software development domains, such as desktop applications and embedded systems. You can occasionally find me huddled up with friends trying to debug server problems at 2:00 am on a Saturday, otherwise I'm probably bouldering at a nearby climbing gym, shredding snow on the mountains of the Northeast, or working on projects at my local <a href="https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/">Maker Space</a>. When I'm stuck at home I could be coding or playing video games--it's a coin flip. Sometimes I read a book, too.
