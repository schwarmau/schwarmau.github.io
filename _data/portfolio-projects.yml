    My personal website has been my introduction to jekyll, and a chance for me to explore design outside of an enterprise environment.
    <br />
    It may not be very feature-rich, but it's minimal, it's robust, and it's mine.

    I'm creating a movie streaming service to watch movies with my friends. For now this is just a fork of another movie streaming project built with Go, but I plan to rewrite this in python and design around the HLS protocol.

    This was a two-semester collaborative project to present at the end of my senior year of college as an undergraduate. As a team of 6 classmates, now friends, we developed an app to replace the physical form of a passport used by Connecticut wineries for a rewards program.

    One of my first big projects in college was to create an app with a classmate to accept user input about restaurant preferences and present a list of restaurants nearby that fit the criteria using Google Maps APIs.

    I've created a <a href="/studyguide/index.html">study guide</a> for software engineering interviews, with some help from friends. It's primarily markdown compiled and built with the rust-made mdbook tool. I'm constantly updating it as I become more experienced, so keep an eye out!
