    My personal website has been my introduction to jekyll, and a chance for me to explore design outside of an enterprise environment.
    <br />
    It may not be very feature-rich, but it's minimal, it's robust, and it's mine.

    I've created a <a href="/studyguide/index.html">study guide</a> for software engineering interviews, with some help from friends. It's primarily markdown compiled and built with the rust-made mdbook tool. I'm constantly updating it as I become more experienced, so keep an eye out!

    I'm creating a movie streaming service to watch movies with my friends. For now this is just a fork of another movie streaming project built with Go, but I plan to rewrite this in python and design around the HLS protocol.

    Pleroma is a server and frontend for <a href="https://the-federation.info/">The Federation</a> (you may already be familiar with an alternative project known as Mastodon). I have started creating a dockerfile to containerize it, and I am redesigning the frontend to my liking. Eventually the final product will be deployed and available at pleroma.cyborg.cafe!

    These are a series of 3 extensions for <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>. <a href="https://github.com/schwarmau/Blazor.Redux">One</a> to implement redux, <a href="https://github.com/schwarmau/Blazor.Canvas">one</a> to wrap the HTML5 canvas API, and <a href="https://github.com/schwarmau/Blazor.Storage">one</a> to wrap the browser storage API. These have since been abandoned because I don't have the capacity to maintain them, and old alternatives have gotten better in addition to new alternatives popping up.
