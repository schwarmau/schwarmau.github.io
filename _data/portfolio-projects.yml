    My personal website has been my introduction to jekyll, and a chance for me to explore design outside of an enterprise environment.
    <br />
    It may not be very feature-rich, but it's minimal, it's robust, and it's mine.

    I've created a study guide for software engineering interviews! It's primarily markdown compiled and built with the rust-made mdbook tool. I'm constantly updating it as I become more experienced, so keep an eye out!

    I'm creating a movie streaming service to watch movies with my friends. For now this is just a fork of another movie streaming project built with Go, but I plan to rewrite this in python and design around the HLS protocol.

    Pleroma is a server and frontend for <a href="https://the-federation.info/">The Federation</a> (you may already be familiar with an alternative project known as Mastodon). I have not yet begun contributing to the server code, although I have created a dockerfile to containerize it, and I am redesigning the frontend to my liking (not for contribution). Eventually the final product will be deployed and available at pleroma.cyborg.cafe!
